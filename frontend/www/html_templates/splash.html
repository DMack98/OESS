  <h4>About this Service:</h4>

  <p>
    As part of the first phase of the Network Development and Deployment Initiative(NDDI), the Open Science, Scholarship and Services Exchange(OS3E) provides a coast to coast  intra-domain dynamic virtual circuit service, letting users provision VLANs on an OpenFlow based infrastructure.  Currently, the NDDI substrate contains 4  OpenFlow 1.0 compatible NEC PF5820 switches in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington D.C. interconnected with 10GE circuits.   This service is based upon the Open Exchange Software Suite(OESS) developed by Indiana University in partnership with Internet2 and Stanford University's Clean Slate program.
