      <p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
    

      <p>To throw a loop on a circuit select the node where you want the loop node.  Once the loopback is thrown all traffic recieved for that circuit on that node will be sent back out the interface it was recieved on. Only one loop per-circuit is allowed.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>For example if you have a circuit from A to Z and you place a loopback on the circuit.  All traffic from A will return to A and all traffic from Z will be returned to Z.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Once the loop is thrown it can be removed by returning to the circuit details page and clicking the "Remove Loop" button.</p>
