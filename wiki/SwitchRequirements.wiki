In order for the software to work, the switches must be able to support the Openflow 1.0 specification. In particular, the software makes use of the following features of the specification:

- Report flow stats

- Support rules that match on input port

- Support rules that match on vlan tag

- Support rules that set the output port of a flow

- Support rules that change the vlan tag of a flow

- Support rules that send packets to controller

- Support rules that match on ether type

- Support removing flows

- Support barrier messages


If multipoint functionality is desired, the switch must support the ability to have a rule like the following:

Match: input port, vlan tag
Action: set vlan tag, output, set vlan tag, output
