= Changes for OE-SS over time =

== 1.0.7 ==

 * Add data refresh to discovery data tables.
 * OESS usage graph show interface description
 * OE-SS ability to browse list of interfaces and their descriptions
 * Display all DPIDs in HEX
 * Add circuit CLR To UI
 * Add ability to force "re-provision" circuit
 * Dynamic sizing for workgroup selector box (along with the next buttons)
 * Add ability to search for workgroup or user
 * Remove internal circuit 'identifier' from UI as it is not useful to users
 * Properly Display nodes as having no endpoints in circuit provisioning if user does not have access to any endpoints on that node.
 * OESS UI Refresh: Users Tab, Actions Section
 * OE-SS Edit circuit (with a backup path) leaves primary path in deploying state
 * OE-SS allows for link decomisioning even with backup paths on that link
 * Add OE-SS Network Status Page
 * Add the available resources tab
 * Make feedback button mailto configurable
 * SNAPP config gen for OE-SS bombing with undefined host_id
 * Add ability for OESS to manage edge port vlan restrictions
 * Fix bug where fwdctl on device connect does not reset flowmod count to 0
 * Resolve bug where multi-point circuits in OE-SS have too many actions causing dup packets
 * Cleanup Internal errors in nox
 * Resolve bug which results in handling of  OE-SS OSCARS topology submission with duplicate entries
 * Resolve bug where OE-SS is not counting existing flows against the max-flow-mods during diff
 * Resolve bug where OE-SS rule diffing breaks vlans with untagged endpoint
 * Resolve Bug where port down events firing too fast causing "double" fail over
 * Resolve OESS UI Bug: Network Status / Available Resources page does not clear the Map Session Data
 * Resolve OESS Bug: Scheduler reporting
 * Resolved bug where OE-SS topology submission not including edge interfaces

== 1.0.6 ==

  * OE-SS links once decomed can be re-approved
  * all interfaces including down interfaces can be approved/provisioned
  * added the ability to insert a node in the middle of a path
  * Added support for per-device rate limiting for sending FlowMods
  * added ability to detect a port add event and push flowmods as needed
  * added the ability to have a per-node rule limit
  * fixed an issue with the IDC integration preventing IDC circuit creation


== 1.0.5 ==

  * Added the ability to do Hairpin (in and out same interface different vlan) circuits in OE-SS
  * Added user sorting in the Admin UI
  * Changed a limit of 10 characters to 255 for usernames
  * Added an Admin Link the UI if a user is an administrator
  * Admin UI is now protected internally via OE-SS configured policy
  * Fixed a bug that prevented some inter-domain circuit from successfully provisioning

== 1.0.4 ==

  * Added the ability to force a failover of a circuit to a backup path
  * Added a workgroup type field allowing for groups to be administrator and see all circuits for all workgroups
  * Removed the reserved BW setting for intra-domain circuits (since no one supports queueing doesn't support this)
  * Fixed a query that prevented us from using circuits in the shortest path calculation when there was 0 BW remaining

== 1.0.3 ==

  * Added a nddi_readonly dbus section
  * Added a monitoring webservice capable of only checking on node status

== 1.0.2 ==

  * Removed flush tables from NOX on node connect
  * Implemented flow diffing in FWDCTL allowing traffic forwarding even if a node disconnects and reconnects

== 1.0.1 ==

  * a few bug fixes

==1.0.0 ==

  * First release on an unsuspecting world!!!
