1a. Have Mysql and Apache running and know the mysql administrator password

   this will guide you through the initial configuration of OESS, including setting up the
   databases and do some initial configuration
2a. Start the OESS processes through the OESS init script (/etc/init.d/oess)

3. Configure Apache and get it running (our apache config should get you most fo the way)
